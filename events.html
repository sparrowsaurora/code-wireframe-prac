Also check out the WalkGPS website (link to https://www.walkgps.com.au/ ) as a great resource for more information about bushwalks in the Perth Hills and greater Southwest region of WA.  

We encourage members to subscribe to this site as it has great resources and, being privately sponsored, will only be able to keep up-to-date with assistance from those of us that use it.  -->
