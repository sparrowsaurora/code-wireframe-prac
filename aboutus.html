<!-- About Us heading 

The Happy Trekkers Club was founded in 1972. We actively supported the establishment of the Bibbulmun Track and still assist with maintenance of the Northern Terminus and track through to Mundaring. We co-ordinate walks on the Track with the Bibbulmun Track Foundation (have a link to the foundation).
